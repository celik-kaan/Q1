"""Write the function â€˜make_couplesâ€™. The function takes two parameters. The first parameter is a list of unique names. The
second parameter is the desired number of couples. The function returns a dictionary: each item represents a unique couple
of names (you use the first name as the key, the second name as the value). The number of couples in the dictionary
matches the number you requested.
The function first checks whether the requested number of pairs can be formed. Then it makes all the pairs: choose two
different people from the list each time. Add them to the dictionary. Make sure that the same person is not chosen twice.
Finally, return the dictionary."""
